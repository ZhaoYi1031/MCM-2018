每年的CPI的数据，采用的C列是TOT(不需要FOOD信息) 以及D列是AGRWTH的信息，这样得到的数据，例如中文2016年是2.01%

CPI数据一是环比，即与上一个时间点相比，月CPI浮动太大，一般都是季度或者半年，一年（我们csv里是一年）

Inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) is defined as the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services that are typically purchased by specific groups of households. Inflation is measured in terms of the annual growth rate and in index, 2010 base year with a breakdown for food, energy and total excluding food and energy. Inflation measures the erosion of living standards. A consumer price index is estimated as a series of summary measures of the period-to-period proportional change in the prices of a fixed set of consumer goods and services of constant quantity and characteristics, acquired, used or paid for by the reference population. Each summary measure is constructed as a weighted average of a large number of elementary aggregate indices. Each of the elementary aggregate indices is estimated using a sample of prices for a defined set of goods and services obtained in, or by residents of, a specific region from a given set of outlets or other sources of consumption goods and services.
